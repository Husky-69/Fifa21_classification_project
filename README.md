# Unlocking Future Stars: Predicting High-Potential Football Players with Machine Learning

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Smart scouting is pretty important, especially if it's outshining a big budget .Sifting through thousands of young players worldwide, all while working with a tight budget, can be quite a challenge. You need to know: Which of these kids will grow into a world-class player? Miss a future star, and you lose a chance to build a legacy. Sign the wrong player, and you waste millions. It’s a high-stakes gamble, and the pressure is on.

That’s where my project comes in. I’ve harnessed the power of data science to act like your ultimate scouting assistant. Using a massive dataset from the FIFA 21 game, packed with details on over 18,000 players—think skills, market value, and more—I’ve built a tool to predict which young players, aged 23 or under, have what it takes to reach the elite level, like a Lionel Messi or Kylian Mbappé. The model doesn’t just guess; it learns patterns from the data to spot players with that special potential, even if they’re flying under the radar. 

##  OBJECTIVES

The key objectives to be achieved by this study are as follows:

1. **Find Young Players Who Can Become Stars**: Build a tool to predict which players aged 23 or younger will likely reach an elite level (Overall Rating ≥ 80), helping the club spot future top performers early.

2. **Save Money and Time in Scouting**: Create a model that shortlists the most promising players, so the scouting team can focus on the best targets without wasting resources on less likely prospects.

3. **Give the Club a Competitive Edge**: Use data to identify undervalued players before bigger clubs notice them, allowing the club to sign talent at a lower cost and build a stronger team.
